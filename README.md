# PaymentsStory
This app displays the Current account balance and the list of Payments in a table. The test data are manually inserted to the Database.

- For Front-end I used simple html, js, and css for displaying the data I get from the Ajax call from the APIs.
- For Backend I chose ASP.NET Core and I also tried to use some EF Core for inserting and getting data to the DB.
- I used InMemory database provider to be used for local testing.

Running the solution:
- Clone or download the solution from: https://github.com/danielcollarin/PaymentsStory
- Open and load in Visual Studio
- Press f5 to run the solution
- Your default web browser will open you will be redirected to https://localhost:5001/
